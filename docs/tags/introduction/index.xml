      <description>Naive Observations Unlike most other languages I learned, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t many surprises for me with F#. This was mostly because I was eased into the languages through Scott&amp;rsquo;s book. I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to learn it while reading it, but still had to comprehend what the codes were trying to tell me. While the book&amp;rsquo;s wisdom is easily transferrable to other languages, it&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of the syntax which led me to explore the language further.</description>

      <description>This article made me learn my second language when I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even gained confidence in my first. And I ended up trying to use the new one more- slowing down both for awhile and affecting my CSC135 grade. By the time I touched my third, I ended up gaining more confidence on the first two; the fourth one had me cross pollinating patterns and practices.
Languages that taught me newer ways to think, sported interesting &amp;ldquo;super powers&amp;rdquo;, and/or were just plain fun kept being used/enjoyed/talked about; others didn&amp;rsquo;t go beyond syntaxes.</description>
