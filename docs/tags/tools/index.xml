      <description>Naive Observations Unlike most other languages I learned, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t many surprises for me with F#. This was mostly because I was eased into the languages through Scott&amp;rsquo;s book. I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to learn it while reading it, but still had to comprehend what the codes were trying to tell me. While the book&amp;rsquo;s wisdom is easily transferrable to other languages, it&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of the syntax which led me to explore the language further.</description>
