<h2 id="naive-observations">Naive Observations</h2>

<p>Unlike most other languages I learned, there wasn&rsquo;t many surprises for me with <em>F#</em>. This was mostly because I was eased into the languages through Scott&rsquo;s book. I didn&rsquo;t intend to learn it while reading it, but still had to comprehend what the codes were trying to tell me. While the book&rsquo;s wisdom is easily transferrable to other languages, it&rsquo;s the beauty of the syntax which led me to explore the language further.</p>

<p>I had prior (and brief) encounter with ReasonML and that was my only ML before this. The differences <em>F#</em> seemed to sport in syntax felt pleasant to me. That was followed by blind explorations at <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a>. There was nothing wrong with the syntax till I&rsquo;ve <code>Console.WriteLine</code>ed something and saw the parenthesis, where <code>printfn</code> did not. That&rsquo;s where I started looking into .NET integration and the slight syntax differences were something I didn&rsquo;t like as much. But I guess that&rsquo;s why I put <strong>Naive Observations</strong> as the title here.</p>

<p>Lots of F# tutorials felt like they were targeting C# programmers. Many had lots of .NET terms in it (I had to google BCL). The same thing goes for object oriented treatments. I am not saying those are bad things but I wondered how interesting the learning experience might get if I spend the first few weeks filtering out the objects and non F# things and extract the functional parts? That <em>could</em> keep some challenges at bay while inviting new ones? I guess I&rsquo;ll find out.</p>

<h2 id="unboxing">Unboxing</h2>

<p>Even without trying, I was expecting the installation to be painful as I&rsquo;m using Linux and am unwilling to change my OS because of just one language. I head off <a href="https://fsharp.org/use/linux/">here</a> and it started to work fine, no pain involved. The VSCode integration was perfect as expected. I later ended up installing <code>dotnet</code> as well.</p>

<p>I fired up <code>fsharpi</code> and typed out <code>printfn &quot;Hello F#&quot;</code>, it worked fine.</p>

<p>Then I fire up the console and  create <code>~/repos/fsharp/first</code>, then <code>echo 'printfn &quot;Hello World&quot;' &gt; Hello.fs</code>, <code>fsharpc Hello.fs</code>, <code>./Hello.fs</code>.</p>

<p>Now I am equipped to explore the language in a <code>REPL</code> and also store some code and run it.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-file">Running a File</h2>

<p>Since I installed <code>dotnet</code>, I <em>can</em> do a <code>dotnet new console -lang F#</code> and followed by a tool of <code>dotnet build</code> and <code>dotnet run</code> etc, I can run project. The process is documented <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-command-line">here</a>.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t know what a <code>sln</code> file is, and I really think that would be a noise in my learning experience, learning the build tool and all that. So I&rsquo;d stay within command line with common faces. In the previous section I had run a single file source code, now I would go multiple.</p>

<p>So my directory is <code>~/repos/fsharp/first</code> and added two files to it- <code>Pi.fs</code> and <code>Main.fs</code>. My intention was to add an <code>pi</code> as a value in one file and print it from the other. Lots of trials and errors happened here. There&rsquo;s <code>namespace</code> and <code>module</code>. Any except the last source file needs to have those. To use a namespace you need to <code>open</code> it. So at the end, my files looked like-</p>

<p><code>Pi.fs</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-fsharp">module Main.Library

let pi = 3.1416
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>Main.fs</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-fsharp">open Main.Library

printfn &quot;%s&quot; pi
</code></pre>

<p>To run it, I did a <code>fsharpc *.fs</code> followed by <code>./Program.exe</code> and it worked. However, when playing around again it didn&rsquo;t. The order of file inputs that you feed to the compiler is important and <code>*.fs</code> had changed orders based on last edits of the file. It is important that I put the &ldquo;Entry Point&rdquo; last. So <code>fsharpc Pi.fs Main.fs</code> works <em>all the time</em>. Will get more treatment of this once I get to compile complexly related files. Hopefully fun times ahead.</p>

<p>As for editor, the <a href="https://spacevim.org/">SpaceVim</a> <code>fsharp layer</code> looked fine, I&rsquo;ve been running codes on it while writing this post. Except for some repl integration didn&rsquo;t seem to work. But I think I&rsquo;ll use it for now, keep things light.</p>

<h2 id="repl">REPL</h2>

<p>I have always been a big fan of REPLs. I&rsquo;ve been introduced to that lifestyle by Python and I felt immediately productive as I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like that before. Richer the REPL experience, more engaging the language is for me. I usually head to the interactive modes of languages way before trying to save the files. If the experience isn&rsquo;t at par and the language isn&rsquo;t a job/school requireent, I run and hide.</p>

<p>For <code>F#</code> it was a bit different as I had experienced <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a>, the runtime was alien to me, and my purpose was to use one chunk of the system, so I had to make sure I&rsquo;d know how equipped I&rsquo;ll be. So I started out with the file and then moved on to the REPL.</p>

<p>The interactive mode of <em>F#</em> is not as great as ones Python or Elixir have. At least not at first look. There&rsquo;s some code intelligence, an okayish timing tool, some silencers, readline support etc. But not multiline history editing, magic commands, in-code documentation. Not that I could know of at first try. But that&rsquo;s good enough, typed languages are more fun on the editor I guess, it allows you to put some thought and attention the paradigm deserves.</p>

<p>Anyway, <code>fsharpi</code> lets me go to interactive mode and write codes there. Thus far I just tried out simpler things but surely I&rsquo;ll try to see how power users use it and write about it some day. For now, my opinion is that <em>F#</em> has an average REPL. That&rsquo;d do.</p>

<h2 id="oo-and-c">OO and C</h2>

<p>Yes <em>F#</em> is a multiparadigm language and no matter how functional first it is, that side of the featureset is inevitable. I will just try to delay that.</p>

<p>I am not against Object Oriented Programming. That was the first paradigm I was introduced to and the only one for the next year or so. But functional half of <em>F#</em> seemed pretty full featured to me. Especially because I am not using it for my job or something and I have all the time I need.</p>

<p>Whatever I said before becomes easier to accomplish by minimizing C#iness and hardcore .NET intervension. I will try to use pure F# libraries (Is that the term they use?) whenever possible, and note down the use cases where mixed paradigm looks inevitable, probably make a wrapper at least. But something tells me it will unlikely be the case.</p>

<h2 id="link-list">Link List</h2>

<p>So what am I using as learning aid? I have <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional">Domain Modeling gone Functional</a> already but that is not exactly about learning the language. I was browsing HumbleBundle yesterday and saw <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/learn-you-some-code-books">this</a>. There&rsquo;s an <em>F#</em> book there. It&rsquo;s kindof old but I like the feelings of sequencial learning experience books offer. So bought it yesterday and looks like it&rsquo;s a nice book. No <em>F#</em> reference list can be complete without mentioning of <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/">Scott&rsquo;s site</a> and the ~2000 pages worth wisdom that gets generated, yet it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be too intimidating or overwhelming. And then there&rsquo;s the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/">Microsoft Guide</a>. There&rsquo;s <code>/r/fsharp</code> and lots of really friendly individuals in Twitter-land.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all reference in my arsenal and I&rsquo;m sure it will improve. No section of reference should be complete without mentioning the &ldquo;Awesome X&rdquo; and for <em>F#</em> it&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/awesome-fsharp">here</a></p>

<h2 id="coming-soon">Coming Soon</h2>

<p>I intend to dive deep into making functions in <em>F#</em> later today. So that&rsquo;s what I will write about, as I&rsquo;m working with them. I may have a head start during last week&rsquo;s playing around but I will replay those too.</p>
