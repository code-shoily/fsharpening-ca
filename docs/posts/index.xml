      <description>This article made me learn my second language when I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even gained confidence in my first. And I ended up trying to use the new one more- slowing down both for awhile and affecting my CSC135 grade. By the time I touched my third, I ended up gaining more confidence on the first two; the fourth one had me cross pollinating patterns and practices.
Languages that taught me newer ways to think, sported interesting &amp;ldquo;super powers&amp;rdquo;, or were just plain fun kept being used/enjoyed; others didn&amp;rsquo;t go beyond syntaxes.</description>
