[This](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) article made me learn my second language when I hadn't even gained confidence in my first. And I ended up trying to use the new one more- slowing down both for awhile and affecting my CSC135 grade. By the time I touched my third, I ended up gaining more confidence on the first two; the fourth one had me cross pollinating patterns and practices.

Languages that taught me newer ways to think, sported interesting "super powers", or were just plain fun kept being used/enjoyed; others didn't go beyond syntaxes. I `Hello World`ed *F#* last week followed by some gratifying *REPL*ing. It let me enjoy some new syntax, platform, and paradigm experiences. I will be writing about those experiences here.

I have type system envy. I always wanted to know a~~n enjoyable (I **did** work with Java and Golang)~~ statically typed language. I was mostly busy all of last year and most part of this one, and when I had some time, I started language shopping. *Elm* felt too limiting, *ReasonML*'s JavaScript resemblance wasn't for me, and that led me to *OCaml*. But I got distracted and later on refocused on my *Elixir* project. It was during that time I was browsing Pragmatic Programmer books and [Domain Modeling gone Functional](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional) caught my attention. My intention behind getting that book was to mentally convert the *F#* codes therein to *Elixir* and I did, till I followed the author's [website](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/), and speed read some of his posts. The syntax seemed clean and expressive, .NET was a never before explored territory, and I could see the possibility of learning a new trick or two, I got hooked.

When learning a new programming language, I write numerous notes, draw lots of circles, triangles and squares and wavy arrows connecting them. I have a set of questions, combining answers to which creates an overview of the syntax. I often end up checking back those notes when I start using the language seriously. This time around, I'd like to try out sharing publishing those thoughts and experiences in here. With the great community F# has, probably my mistakes would be corrected, best practices pointed out and questions answered? Or maybe someone out there interested in *F#* who has the same outlook in programming could be benefitted from it?

I just finished speed reading some tutorials and examples, browsing the subreddit and tweets, checking out table of contents of books and cross referencing them with documentations and I'm still writing this. Looks like I survived the step 0. Step 1 usually involves a more disciplined approach and clearer short-term intents. Along with that comes implementing algorithms, solving challenges, modeling real-life scenario and mining books and guides. This is the same thing I go through for all things I learn, only this time, I will share the experiences and references.

**tl;dr:** I have decided to seriously learn F# and I will share my experiences with it here.
